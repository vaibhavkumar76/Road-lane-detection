# Road-lane-detection
In This project the aim was to build a AI model to speed up the lane detection of the roads.The videos were downloaded from kaggle to help identify the road lane automatically by a vehicle software.

In this task we have sample video for training. the video is uploaded in files section as testing_video5.mp4 you can download it from there.
I have started this simple model by applying a canny edge detection and by masking the region of interest and finally the lanes of road are detected
The final output video we get as the lanes are marked with the highlighting them with color.
